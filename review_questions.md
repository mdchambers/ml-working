### Chapter 1

1. How would you define Machine Learning?

Algorithms that adapt/change as they analyze data

1. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?

No

1. What is a labeled training set?

Training set with correct labels attached to each data point

1. What are the two most common supervised tasks?

Classification and regression

1. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?

Clustering, visualization, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning

1. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?

reinforcement learning

1. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?

Clustering

1. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?

Supervised

1. What is an online learning system?

A system that learns as it classfies

1. What is out-of-core learning?

Learning from data sets too large to hold in memory

1. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

instance-based

1. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?

A hyperparamater is not part of the model but controls regularization (to prevent overfitting) during learning

1. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

Finding coefficients of a linear (polynomial etc) equation applied to the data sets

1. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

Overfitting, underfitting, bad data, bad model

1. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

Solution optimized for a non-representative subset of the data. Alter training set, change hyperparamater, use validation set

1. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?

To evaluate the goodness-of-fit

1. What is the purpose of a validation set?

To evaluate the appropriateness of the hyperparamaters

1. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?

Solution might not be generalizable to actual data

1. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?

More accurate solution
